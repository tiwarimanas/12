                            <p>The tragic irony is profound - just as Derry has found the courage to pursue meaningful relationships and assert his independence, his newfound friend dies. The fall from the ladder symbolizes the fragility of life and human connections.</p>
                            <p>Derry's transformation is complete - he has overcome his fears and limitations, though tragically his mentor is gone. His calling Mr. Lamb "Lamey-Lamb" shows his complete acceptance and affection.</p>
